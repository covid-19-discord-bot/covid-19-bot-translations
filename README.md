Translations for the COVID-19 bot

# I want to help translate!
DM 0/0#0001 on Discord with the language you want to translate the bot into, and your email address. Your email will only be used to invite you to LingoHub, and no other purposes.
Because I have a Student account on LingoHub, your entire job is to figure out if the machine-translations are correct, and if not, fix them.
Thanks for being interested!
